linked list
1. function list A = list B?

1. solution 1:
copy to arrays/vectors
sort them then compare one by one: 

T: O(nlgn), S: O(n)

2. hashing
hash set S for A, for each element in B check S

T: O(n), S: O(n)

3. methods with probability to be wrong:
    Compute sum
    Compute product (if 0 in the list)
    Xor

    A -> sketch S_A
    B -> sketch S_B
    S_A != S_B => A != B
    
goal: isEqual -> randomized

if A=B, then P_R{isEqual(A, B} = 1
if A!=B, then P_R{isEqual(A, B} -> 0

h \in H - hash family (random oracle model)

S_A = \sum h(a)
S_B = \sum h(b)

h: u -> {0, ..., 2^d-1}

h - random oracle
if |A| != |B|, then it is easily differentiable
1. A is a permutation of B -> IsEqual(A, B) = true
2. A is not a permutation of B (but |A| = |B|)
a* \in A \ B (set difference)
P{\sum h(a) = \sum h(b)}
  = P{h(a*) = \sum_{b in B} h(b) - \sum_{a \in A\a*} h(a)}
     |----L----|  |-----R--random variable, independent of h(a*)|
  = 1 / 2^d
 
since:
(L and R are independent, supported by the random oracle model)
(L  is uniform distributed)

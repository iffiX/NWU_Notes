Universal families of hash functions

Scenarios:

Senario 1.:
   hash 0, ..., N \in u, to 0, ..., n-1
   where n is the number of hash buckets

   pick a prime number p > N, (p is deterministic here, randomness is in a and b)
   N < p <= 2N (we can always find such a prime number)

   let H = {h_{ab} : h_{ab} X -> ((ax + b) mod p) mod n}
   s.t.: 1 <= a < p and 0 <=b < p
   \mathcal{Z_p} = {0, ..., p -1}
   \mathcal{Z}/_p\mathcal{Z} are fields

   Operayions
   a+b mod p - addition
   a*b mod p - multiplication
   (p + a -b) mod p - subtraction
   a/b is defined as a = b * q mod p on the field

   (q in \mathcal{Z}/_p)

  claim: H is universal hash family

  proof: suppose x \in u and y \in u, x != y
     then for collision:
     [  ax + b = u mod p ]
     [ ay + b = v mod p ]
     [  u = v mod n          ]

   =>:
      ( x 1 ) (a) = (u)   mod p
      ( y 1 ) (b)     (v)
   and u = v mod n   

  =>:
     for any x, y
     exists one to one correspondence between (a, b) that cause collisions 
     and pairs (u, v) 
     
     s.t. u = v mod n, u v \in \mathcal{Z}_p
       
     (because x != y, the coefficient matrix with x and y is invertible
       (u v) is on field \mathcal{Z)_p, you can understand it as real field)

  =>:
	u = v mod p conditions:
	v \in {u, u + n, u+2n, ..., u+kn} and u+kn <= p - 1 mod p
	v number <= \ceil((p-1)/n)
	
	Note: only if a != 0, then u != v mod p is possible, otherwise u will always equal to v
	because (x 1) * (a b) mod p = u mod p
	              (y 1) * (a b) mod p = v mod p
	and x != y
	
	u + kn <= p - 1 -> k <= (p-1)/n
	
	number of pairs (u, v): -> p * \ceil((p-1)/n)
	
	total pairs of (u, v) is determined by (a, b): p * (p - 1), (b in 0~p-1, a in 1~p-1
	
	so probability of h_{ab}(x) = h_{ab}(y) <= 1/n


Senario 2:
    u = {0, 1}^m (binary strings of length m)
    we have n buckets, n = 2^d
    m >> d
    
    random matrix A_{dm} (d rows and m columns) 
    A_{dm} in {0, 1}^{d \mul m}
    use A for short
    
    h_A = Ax mod 2 (x is a binary vector of length m, {0, 1}^m)

theorem: {h_A} is a universay hash family
    
proof:  Ax = Ay mod 2 (x != y) creates a collision
    A(x - y) = 0 mod 2 (x != y)
    
    let z = x -y, (so z is determinstric here)
    Az = 0 mod 2 (z != 0)
    
    A = (a_1)    (z_1)
           (a_2) * (z_2) = vector 0
           (a_d)    (z_m) 
           
    goal: P{Az = 0} <= 1/2^d for z != 0
    stands if: 
    -  P{<a_i, z> = 0 mod 2} = 1/2
    - All products <a_1, z> mod 2 ... <a_d, z> mod 2 are independent
    
    for second condition:
    a_1 ~ a_d are row vectors of dimension m
    all products <a_1, z> mod 2 ... <a_d, z> mod 2 are independent,
    (if a_i are chosen independently)
    
    for first condition:
    claim: P{<a_i, z> = 0 mod 2} = 1/2:
        
    <a_i, z> mod 2 
    = \sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{ij} * z_j mod 2
    
    suppose j_0 is the index of a non-zero element in z vector:
    (0 ... 1 ...)
            ^- j_0
    
    Note z_[j_0] = 1
    = \sum_{j=1, j != j_0}^{m} a_{ij} * z_j + a_{ij_0} * z_{j_0} mod 2
       |----------------------L-------------------------|    |-----------R----------|
       
    need to prove P{L+R=0 mod2} = 1/2
    P{R=0} = P{R=1} = 1/2 
    
    since L is not dependent on R
    # for any given L, their is a R that makes L+R=0 mod 2, and probability of this specific R is 1/2
    P{L+R=0 mod 2|L} = 1/2
    P{L+R=0 mod2} = \E_L{P{L+R=0 mod 2|L}} = 1/2

An application: hash in chromium src
gperf: a perfect hash function generator

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect hashing: never colides
|u| << n (universe size << bucket size)

why not use identity as the hash function? because we want universal hash values: eg: a html tag (string) into uint64

Algorithm used to create a perfect hashing function
h: u -> {0, ..., n-1}
        
n = c * |u|^2
     
pick a random h \in H-universal hash family, h doesn't have a collision

\E_{h \in H} {numbr of pairwise collisions}
= \E_{h} {\sum_{x, y \in u, x != y} \I {h(x) = h(y)}}
= \sum_{x, y \in u} P_{h \in H}{h(x) = h(y)}
= (|u|) * 1/n   (by definition of binomial coefficient)
    (2)
= |u|(|u| - 1) / 2n

for n = |u|^2, E{...} <= 1/2

by markov: P{|x| >= t} <= E{|X|} / t, t > 0
P{number of collisions >= t} <= E{...} / t

so pairwise collisions >= 1, probability is less than 1/2
     
           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to deal with these collisions in the perfect hashing (above), we might use a second level of hash table to further split up collisions in bucket.

first level bucket size: 0 ... n-1, one has k collisions
second level bucket size: 0 ... k^2 - 1

performance analysis:
\E {\sum_i {load(i) ^ 2}} <= O(|u|)

proof: \E_h \sum_i (\sum_x \I {h(x) = i})^2 = 
                              |--------------------------| load of bucket i in first level
= \E_h \sum_i (\sum_{x, y \in u} \I{h(x) = i} \I{h(y) = i})
= \sum_{x, y \in u} \E_h \sum_i {\I{h(x) = i} \I{h(y) = i}}
                                 |---- P{h(x) = h(y)} ----------------------|
<= \sum_{x, y \in u} { 1, x = y
                                   { 1/n, x != y
= O(|u|) (because 1*|u| + 1/n * |u| * |u| = O(|u|))
(note |u| < |n|)
